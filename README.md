# Form to create account

My project is a simple HTML form for user registration.

# Getting started

The best way to get started is to follow these 3 steps:

1. **Clone the repository:** To begin, clone the repository to your local machine using Git. Run this command in your terminal:
   `git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git`
2. **Navigate to the project directory:** Move into the project directory using the cd command:
   `cd your-repository`
3. **Start a local server:** Utilize any local server tool of your preference to serve the files. For instance, if you have the Live Server extension installed in Visual Studio Code, you can right-click on the index.html file and select "Open with Live Server" to launch a local server and preview the application in your browser.

And you're all set! You should now have the project running smoothly on your local machine.

# Changes

1. Changed the page title 'Login' to 'Registration';
2. Edited date format to 'MM/DD/YYYY';
3. Added placeholder to date field because it makes keyboard input easier;
4. Now the checkbox border has a standard style. It is more visible this way;
5. The error message is created at my discretion.
